Dependency Injection is a fundamental aspect of the Spring framework, through which the Spring container “injects” objects into other objects or “dependencies”.

Simply put, this allows for loose coupling of components and moves the responsibility of managing components onto the container.

IOC(Inversion of Control). The Spring-Core module is responsible for injecting dependencies through either Constructor or Setter methods.
The design principle of Inversion of Control emphasizes keeping the Java classes independent of each other and the container frees them from object creation and maintenance.
